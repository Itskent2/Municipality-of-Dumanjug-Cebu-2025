            <div class="desc">The municipality of Dumanjug was born more than a hundred years ago. It was in the year
                1855 when the municipality was organized and had for its leader an equivalent to the latter town
                Captain, Pedro Ricamora. A man whose whose descendants wield some kind of political power in the
                municipality.

            <div class="desc">Dumanjug church is probably the most handsome of the 19th century churches in western Cebu.
                Made of finely cut coral, its hews closer to the neoclassical idiom for the sedate and chaste simplicity
                of its decorative elements. The bell tower to one side of the church has a dodecagonal plan, usual for
                colonial churches.
